*Every nation and every country has its own customs and traditions. In Britain traditions play a more important part in the life of the people than in other countries.*


**Englishmen are proud of their traditions and carefully keep them up. It has been the law for about three hundred years that all the theatres are closed on Sundays. No letters are delivered, only a few Sunday papers are published.**
